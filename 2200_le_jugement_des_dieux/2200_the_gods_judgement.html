        <h1>2200: the gods judgement</h1>
        <p><em>A few moments ago, you were still alive. Now you seat still, on a metal chair, in a small waiting room. “Purgatory” is written in large black letters on the door in front of you. You stare at the pale man in gray at the reception desk, waiting for a sign from him to enter the room behind. Where your afterlife will be played out.</em></p>
        <p>A narrative role-playing game for 3 to 4 players, requiring no game master nor preparation. Few rolls will be made but you will need two 8-sided dice (d8), three tokens, and optionally a timer.</p>

                <h2>Synopsis</h2>
                <p>Each of you will play a God, ancient or modern, in charge of deciding the fate of mortals who died in this year 2200. Perhaps this has always been your role? Perhaps this duty is passed from god to god over time ? Either way, you each have your own criteria for judging mortals’s actions, their karma, and the value of their souls. And YOU will decide if they go to Hell or to Heaven.</p>
                <p><img src="img/tensei-inktober2017-crumbling-mask.jpg" alt="Crumbling mask"></p>
                <p>In turn, you will put aside your divine role to play as a Mortal whose actions will be scrutinized by a panel of gods. Your life was spent in the twenty-second century, in the future of our current world, which has become somewhat cyberpunk and dystopian.</p>
                <p><strong>Golden rule - <em>« yes and… »</em></strong> : in this game, as in improv theater, whether you play a Mortal or a God, never question another player’s word. You can bounce back, complete, embellish, qualify the facts, but once stated they have the value of truth. If you need a diegetic reason, consider that the courthouse prevent all lies.</p>

                <h2>The jugement</h2>
                <p>The player to the Mortal’s left assumes the role of the Psychopomp for a few instants. He invites the Mortal into the tribunal, where he introduces the Gods who sit there and their titles. He then introduces the Mortal to the assembly. Each player can play the Psychopomp differently: formal, supportive, snob, wise, unexpected…</p>
                <p>The God usually personified by the player embodying the Mortal is of course absent.</p>
                <p>If you have a timer, make it available to the gods: they will see that the Mortal does not exceed their speaking time, interrupting if necessary.</p>

                    <p>Starting from the left of the Mortal, each God briefly sums up a part of their life, in a detached and factual manner, among:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>their birth and childhood</li>
                        <li>a notable event in their existence</li>
                        <li>the circumstances of their death</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You can take inspiration from the table below:</p>

                        <li>the 2186 Solivox side effects scandal</li>

                        <li>the narcolepsy epidemic of 2176</li>

                    <p>If the life of the Mortal had value in the eyes of certain Gods, they may have used their mystical influence, their powers, to influence their existence. If this is the case, each God is free to mention it at this stage, when describing a biographical element.</p>

                    <p>Starting from the left of Mortal, each God exposes an event where the latter’s actions (or inaction) went against their divine line of conduct.</p>
                    <p>These can be completely mundane situations that the Mortal did not expect to be judged on, but do not hesitate to choose serious events, having had maybe even a major impact on society.</p>
                    <p>If Gods are charitable, they can just expose a situation where the stakes were high, without explaining the Mortal’s actions, and let them describe what happened.</p>
                    <p>The Mortal should be allowed to answer every divine accusation, in order to defend themselves.</p>

                    <p><strong>As an all-knowing God, your goal</strong> is to chastise Mortals who have strayed from the right path according to your values, and reward those who, on the contrary, have respected your moral code. You can even decide to recruit some of them to work for you!</p>
                    <p>Describe the Mortal’s behavior you witnessed, and explain how it is reprehensible for you. Feel free to also defend the Mortal against the other gods, when their actions seem valuable to you!</p>
                    <p>Remember your stature as a god: you are above mortals and they should address you with deference.</p>
                    <p><strong>As a Mortal, your goal</strong> is to convince your judges that on the whole you have lived your life in tune with their divine values, even if you have just discovered those criteria!</p>

                    <p>Once their decision has been made, they vote: each take one of the tokens on the table. They then secretly place it in either their <strong>right hand to save</strong> the Mortal’s soul, and in the <strong>left hand to damn them to Hell</strong>.</p>

                    <p>After the Gods have made a decision, but before they reveal their hands, the Mortal can ask a particular God to complete a challenge of their choice to prove their worth: answer a riddle, deny or sacrifice something, accomplish a feat…</p>
                    <p>The god in question is free to refuse. If they accept, it’s up to them to state the terms of the challenge.</p>
                    <p>Once that is is established, the player embodying the Mortal rolls a d8:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>if the result is <strong>6</strong>, <strong>7</strong> or <strong>8</strong>, the Mortal <strong>succeeds</strong>, they overcome the challenge! The challenged God vote is “bought”: the player has to put the token in their right hand. The player who plays the Mortal has the floor to describe how the challenge unfolded.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>if the result is <strong>1</strong>, <strong>2</strong> or <strong>3</strong>, the Mortal <strong>fails</strong> in the face of the divine challenge. The player who embodies the solicited God has the floor to describe how the Mortal failed.</p>

                        <li>

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If the Mortal fails, the challenged God can always change his vote if they wish.</p>

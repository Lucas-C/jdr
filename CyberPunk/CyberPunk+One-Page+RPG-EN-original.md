# CYPER PUNK
A ONE-PAGE RPG

A TechnoNoir-themed hack of John Harper’s _Lasers & Feelings_

THE YEAR IS 20X6. You are a crew of **Runners** – skilled operatives for hire in the semi-legal twilight between the monolithic megacorporations, vicious gangs, and downtrodden denizens of the neon-soaked urban **Sprawl**. After a botched mission, your leader, **Dar.C**, is in an underground hospital on life support, and your funds are running dangerously thin. You’ll have to take any job you can get just to make it through another week.

## PLAYERS: CREATE YOUR CHARACTER

1. Pick from the following tables or roll **3d6** to determine your **personality**, **background**, and team **role**:

YOU ARE A...
1. Charming
2. Grizzled
3. Naïve
4. Savvy
5. Unhinged
6. Zen

FORMER...
1. Cop
2. Corp Employee
3. Ganger
4. Megacorp Heir

2. Gun-Fu Master
3. Hacker
4. Infiltrator
5. Living Weapon
6. Street Medic

2. Choose your number, from 2 to 5. A high number means you're more **CYBER** (tech, science, logic, precision). A low number means you're more **PUNK** (intuition, improvisation, street smarts, recklessness).

3. Give your character a kickass **cyberpunk name**, like _DekMicr0n_ or _Harmonyx_.

**YOU HAVE**:

* An **augmentation** of your choice (robot arm, bionic eyes, Net-brain interface, etc)
* A **ranged weapon** of your choice (submachine gun, wrist rockets, sniper rifle, sonic blaster, etc)
* A **melee weapon** of your choice (katana, stun baton, titanium knuckles, etc)
* A Net-enabled **personal communication device**
* A sick cyberpunk **outfit**

**YOUR GOAL**: Complete the mission and stay alive.

## PLAYERS: CREATE YOUR TEAM

1. As a group, pick from the following tables or roll 3d6 to determine 2 advantages and 1 disadvantage for your team:

YOUR CREW HAS...
1. A high-tech safehouse
2. An advanced 3D printer
3. A sweet ride
4. High-quality forged credentials
5. Military-grade gear
6. Someone on the inside

BUT THEY...
1. Are in debt to some nasty folks
2. Are new at this
3. Are wanted by corporate police
4. Don’t blend in at all
5. Have a lot of enemies
6. Have scavenged gear

2. Give your team a slick cyberpunk name, too, like The TechRaiders or Chiba 5.

## ROLLING THE DICE

When you do something risky, roll **1d6** to find out how it goes. Roll **+1d** for a favorable situation and **+1d** if you’ve got the right skills/equipment. (The GM tells you how many dice to roll, based on your character and the situation.) Roll your dice and compare each die result to your number.

↧ If you’re using **CYBER** (tech, rationality), you want to roll **under** your number.

↥ If you’re using **PUNK**, (intuition, recklessness) you want to roll **over** your number.

0. **If none of your dice succeed**, it goes wrong. The GM says how things get worse.
1. **If one die succeeds**, you barely manage it. The GM inflicts a complication, harm, or cost.
2. **If two dice succeed**, you do it well. Good job!
3. **If three dice succeed**, you get a critical success! The GM tells you some extra benefit you get.

**If you roll your exact number**, you are a true **CYBERPUNK**. You get a special insight into what’s going on. **Ask the GM a question** and they’ll answer you honestly. You can change your action if you want to, then roll again. **GM**: Frame the answer by explaining how the character knows the new information. Is it something they deduced, intuited, remembered, observed... ?

**HELPING**: If you want to help someone who’s rolling, say how
you try to help them and make a 1d6 roll against your own
number. Add your result to theirs.

## GM: CREATE THE MISSION

Roll **4d6** or pick from the tables below to create the Runners’ **mission**:

THE TEAM HAS BEEN CONTRACTED TO...
1. Destroy/Kill
2. Investigate
3. Protect
4. Recover/Rescue

3. A hyper-rich tech mogul
4. An anarchist biohacker collective
5. The mob/yakuza/triads
6. The Sprawl’s biggest megacorp

BUT...
1. For one of you, it’s personal
2. That part of town is a deathtrap
3. The client says no other deaths
4. The target is in a hyper-secure vault
5. The target moves every 6 hours
6. They know you’re coming

## GM: RUN THE GAME

**Introduce the team** by asking each player **2 questions** about their character. This can be a short flashback to a “job interview” scene between the player and Dar.C. Some good questions: _Why did you decide to become a Runner? What in your former life prepared you for your current role? What do you think of [Character X]?_

**Play to find** out how the Runners complete the mission. **Begin the game** with the team arriving at a **starting location**, or by having a **contact** approach them with a new job.

**Before a threat does something, show signs** that it’s about to happen, then ask what the characters do. _“The technopunk racks his arm-cannon and takes aim at you. What do you do?”_

**Call for a roll** when the situation is uncertain. **Don’t pre-plan outcomes** – let the chips fall where they may. Use failures to push the action forward. The situation always changes after a roll, for good or ill.

If you don't know something, **ask the players**! _“Who’s your contact? What’s the name of the nightclub? Where's the corp scientist’s apartment?”_

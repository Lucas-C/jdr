Text versions :
* [CyberPunk+One-Page+RPG-FR.md](CyberPunk+One-Page+RPG-FR.md)
* [CyberPunk+One-Page+RPG-EN-original.md](CyberPunk+One-Page+RPG-EN-original.md)

There are 2 font families used in the original PDF:
* [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)
* [Industry](https://fortfoundry.com/fonts/industry)

The 2nd one being non-free, I used instead the _Industry Test_ / _Industry Test_ font:
<https://befonts.com/industry-font-family.html>

_Roboto_ & _Industry Test_ must be installed on your system in order to open the `.fodg` file and render it properly.

## Music

Apart from the suggested [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6NmO67xVB5m1E7mptNp1eO),
I recommend this one : [Dystopian playlist @ itch.io](https://timbeek.itch.io/dystopian),
a free collection of Dark Retro Synth tracks composed and Produced by Tim Beek.

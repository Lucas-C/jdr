# RUN. DIE. REPEAT

## BEFORE PLAYING
This is a mini role-playing game designed for short, zero-prep sessions with a crazy fast pace that can be played anytime,
anywere. The game's premise is this:
> You are trapped in a nightmare, hunted by monsters.
> Every time you die, you return to the exact some place and time you started in.
> Will you find your way out?

You don't need character sheets or even pen and paper.
In fact, they are forbidden in his game! All you need to play is:
- One six-sided die.
- A timer.
- Friends.

One player takes the role of the GM (Game Master), who comes up with an inital scene and narrates the outcomes
of the other player's actions.
The rest of players control <u>the same character</u>. They take turns clockwise to make decisions.

Each time the character dies (and this will happen very often), the leading player changes, and a new <u>incarnation</u> begins.

The GM puts a timer showing <u>how much time</u> the players have to find their way out before getting trapped forever
in the nightmare. Everybody has to be focused and think fast!

## SETTING THE TONE
There's urgency and tension in Run, Die, Repeat, but it doesn't have to be a horror game.
Before starting to play, discuss what kind of story you want to explore
(wacky, surrealist, gore, you name it) so everyone is on the same page from the get-go and nobody is uncomfortable at the table.

## PLAYING THE GAME
The GM describes an <u>initial scene</u>, which happens in some kind of closed space,
like a building or a cavern, with monsters chasing the character or other threats around every corner.

The player sitting at GM's left takes the first action and rolls a six-sided die.
- If you get a 6, the action is successful. The GM narrates the outcome and the <u>new scene</u> that emerges from it.
- On a 5 or lower, the character dies and returns to the <u>initial scene</u>. It's next player's turn now.

If an action fails, <u>players can't attempt again</u> the same action in the same scene and must find another thing to do,
until the context has changed significantly.

If an action has succeded, players can successfully repeat the action in the same scene, no rolls needed,
as long as they <u>remember the action</u>.

Players can chain any number of successes of the previous incarnation as they can remember,
but keep in mind that <u>only the GM can take notes</u> on the actions that have succeeded.

The GM can't alter the outcome of a repeated action. Players should be able to recreate a previous scene
by remembering all the successful actions that led to it.

At any time, a player can decide to try a different action, or fail to remember the action
that succeeded in a previous incarnation. That will require a new roll.

When the turn of the player sitting at GM's right is over, the GM can chose to <u>morph the initial situation</u>
into a different one, so players can try again any action they previously failed and keep progressing.

## WINNING THE GAME
You win the game if you manage to escape the place or somehow defeat all enemies before time runs out.
Then, you wake up safe and sound.

## TIPS FOR THE GM
Set the timer somewhere between 20 and 40 minutes. It's hard to maintain tension and memory for a time longer than that.

If you want to give detailed descriptions of the scenery, do it before starting the timer
in order to avoid wasting player's time. Be clear and succinct when narrating.

Don't wait for the right idea to come to mind. Trust your instinct and run with your first thought.

Pace is everything. Present new opportunities after every success, rise the stakes, add threats.

You should morph the initial scene only if players are stuck at the first scenes and out of new ideas.
If they've chained various successes, it's probably a bad idea to morph the initial scene, since they'll lose all progress made.
Instead, remind them they can alter any action in the chain to unlock new scenes.

## INITIAL SCENE SEEDS
This are some ideas to get you started:

> You're in a crypt. The door out is closed and the dead are rising from their tombs. Where is the key?

> You're amidst a wildfire, Flames surround you and there's smoke everywhere, Can you find your way out?

> You wake up in a hospital, but something's wrong. Everything's filthy and rusty, and the personnel attack you at sight.
> How can you escape this nightmare?

Of course, you're encouraged to make up your own initial scenes. To do so, make sure to provide:
- An urgent and oppressive situation.
- Active threats the players need to run from.
- Lots of options and opportunities.
- No railroading.
- A clear goal for the players. They should know what they're looking for, but no exactly where or how.

Have fun playing _Run. Die. Repeat_!

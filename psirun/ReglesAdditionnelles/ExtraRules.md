# <span class="psirun">Psi<span class="asterisk">*</span>Run</span><br> Additional rules
<center>
These entirely optional rules handle some situations not provided for in the rules,
and humbly try to improve the gaming experience.
</center>

## Injuries
For injuries to impact game mechanics:

> A Fugitive with an **untreated wound** must always place a die on the **Wound** Risk without **rolling an additional die**.

## Memories
The players **share their Questions** orally at the start of the game.
Explain that placing a ⚃ or ⚄ in **Souvenir** grants narrative power
who can help the Fugitives, for example by introducing an item or an ally!
<!-- = flashback in Blades in the Dark -->

Sometimes, while investigating his past during the game,
a Fugitive can get answers to his Questions
without placing a die on the Risk **Remembrance**:

> When a player thinks that her Fugitive has found an answer to one of her questions,
> with the GM's agreement she can **read this question** to others.
> Each of them **then offers an explanation**,
> then the initial player chooses the answer she prefers.

## The Track
This rule can be very useful if the Fugitives **outrun** the Pursuers,
in order to restore dramatic tension:

> The GM can decide that the Pursuers catch up with their prey on the Trail
> until the **post-it just behind the Fugitives one**.
>However, this **triggers a Memory** to one of the Fugitives, at their convenience.

**Repel the Pursuers**: if the Fugitives confront and push back the Pursuers in a Location,
the latter move back a notch on the Track.

**Vehicles**: only include them as locations in the Track if the Fugitives stay there **for a scene**, for example a chase.

## Mutual aid
If ever the players help each other to carry out a significant action:

> When the help of one or more Fugitives proves relevant during the action of another Fugitive, the latter can roll an additional die.

> The GM is free to consider that such assistance does not provide a significant advantage depending on the situation.

## Identical action of all Fugitives
Example :

> The three of us take our momentum to jump into the void to the adjacent building.

It can then be laborious to ask the three players for a dice roll:

> When the Fugitives perform the same significant action simultaneously, designate a player who will make a single dice roll, the result of which will determine the overall success of the action.

## Random decisions
Sometimes the Fugitives do not perform any significant action,
but a die roll can be helpful in determining the situation.
Examples:

<p class="half-break"></p>

> Does this stunned guard have a weapon on him?

⇢ It's quite likely, let's say there's a **one chance in two**.

➜ “Choose: even or odd? Then roll a die, and if you predicted correctly, your Fugitive finds a weapon. »

<p class="half-break"></p>

> Are the truck keys stashed in the glove box?

⇢ It's possible but **quite unlikely**.

➜ “Roll a die, on a 6 you find the keys. »

<p class="half-break"></p>

> Which one of you does the monster attack?

⇢ Each Fugitive has **an equal chance** of being attacked.

➜ “Each choose a number between 1 and 6, then the die will determine who will be targeted. »
_(by re-rolling until a player's number is drawn)_

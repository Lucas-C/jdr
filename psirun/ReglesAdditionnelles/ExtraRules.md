Those optional game mechanics handle some specific cases
<br>and try to make your sessions even more fun!
</center>

## Memories
The players **share their questions** orally at the start of the game.
Explain that placing a ⚃ or ⚄ in **Reveal** grants narrative power
who can help the Runners, for example by introducing an item or an ally!
<!-- = flashback in Blades in the Dark -->

> <u>Example:</u> A ⚃ placed in Reveal triggers a narration from the other players to recount this reminiscence. While answering a question with a flashback, they decide to mention that the PC in question had hidden a revolver in the glove compartment of his car. When the flashback ends, the PCs have a good chance of finding the revolver in that glove compartment!

When a player actively has their Runner investigate their past,
following a tenuous trail until they encounter elements
that could very plausibly bring back memories,
the GM may decide to allow the Runner to obtain
an answer to a question without placing a die on the **Reveal** Risk:

> When a player thinks that her Runner has found an answer to one of her questions,
> with the GM's agreement she can **read this question** to others.
> Each of them **then offers an explanation**,
> then the initial player chooses the answer she prefers.

## The Trail
This extra rule can be very useful if the Runners **outrun** the Chasers,
in order to restore dramatic tension:

> If players spend more than 20 minutes of playtime in a place,> advance the Chasers one step on the Trail.

**Repel the Chasers**: If the Runners successfully confront and fight the Chasers in a location,
the Chasers move back one step on the Trail.

**Vehicles**: only include them as locations in the Trail if the Runners stay there **for a scene**, for example a chase.

<br>

### Devil's Bargain
> In a suitable situation, the GM can offer a Runner the chance to **retrieve a memory**,
> and hence choose who answers one of their questions,
> **in exchange for advancing the Chasers on the Trail** to the step immediately behind the Runners.

## When all the Runners perform the same action
Example :

> The three of us take our momentum to jump into the void to the adjacent building.

It can then be laborious to ask the three players for a dice roll:

> When the Runners perform the same significant action simultaneously, only one player makes **a single dice roll**, the result of which will determine the overall success of the action.

## Random decisions
Sometimes the Runners do not perform any significant action,
but a die roll can be helpful in determining the situation.
Examples:

<p class="half-break"></p>

> Does this stunned guard have a weapon on him?

⇢ It's quite likely, let's say there's a **one chance in two**.

➜ “Choose: even or odd? Then roll a die, and if you predicted correctly, your Runner finds a weapon. »

<p class="half-break"></p>

> Are the truck keys stashed in the glove box?

⇢ It's possible but **quite unlikely**.

➜ “Roll a die, on a 6 you find the keys. »

<p class="half-break"></p>

> Which one of you does the monster attack?

⇢ Each Runner has **an equal chance** of being attacked.

➜ “Each choose a number between 1 and 6, then the die will determine who will be targeted. »
_(by re-rolling until a player's number is drawn)_

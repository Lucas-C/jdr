<center>
 Those optional game mechanics handle some specific cases
 <br>
 and try to make your sessions even more fun!
</center>
<h2 id="memories">Memories</h2>
<p>The players <strong>share their questions</strong> orally at the start of the game.
Explain that placing a ⚃ or ⚄ in <strong>Reveal</strong> grants narrative power
who can help the Runners, for example by introducing an item or an ally!</p>
<!-- = flashback in Blades in the Dark -->
<blockquote>
 <p><u>Example:</u> A ⚃ placed in Reveal triggers a narration from the other players to recount this reminiscence. While answering a question with a flashback, they decide to mention that the PC in question had hidden a revolver in the glove compartment of his car. When the flashback ends, the PCs have a good chance of finding the revolver in that glove compartment!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When a player actively has their Runner investigate their past,
following a tenuous trail until they encounter elements
that could very plausibly bring back memories,
the GM may decide to allow the Runner to obtain
an answer to a question without placing a die on the <strong>Reveal</strong> Risk:</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>When a player thinks that her Runner has found an answer to one of her questions,
with the GM's agreement she can <strong>read this question</strong> to others.
Each of them <strong>then offers an explanation</strong>,
then the initial player chooses the answer she prefers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-trail">The Trail</h2>
<p>This extra rule can be very useful if the Runners <strong>outrun</strong> the Chasers,
in order to restore dramatic tension:</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>If players spend more than 20 minutes of playtime in a place,
advance the Chasers one step on the Trail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Repel the Chasers</strong>: If the Runners successfully confront and fight the Chasers in a location,
the Chasers move back one step on the Trail.</p>
<p><strong>Vehicles</strong>: only include them as locations in the Trail if the Runners stay there <strong>for a scene</strong>, for example a chase.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="devil-s-bargain">Devil's Bargain</h3>
<blockquote>
 <p>In a suitable situation, the GM can offer a Runner the chance to <strong>retrieve a memory</strong>,
and hence choose who answers one of their questions,
<strong>in exchange for advancing the Chasers on the Trail</strong> to the step immediately behind the Runners.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="half-break">
<h2 id="when-all-the-runners-perform-the-same-action">When all the Runners perform the same action</h2>
<p>Example&nbsp;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The three of us take our momentum to jump into the void to the adjacent building.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It can then be laborious to ask the three players for a dice roll:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the Runners perform the same significant action simultaneously, only one player makes <strong>a single dice roll</strong>, the result of which will determine the overall success of the action.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="random-decisions">Random decisions</h2>
<p>Sometimes the Runners do not perform any significant action,
but a die roll can be helpful in determining the situation.
Examples:</p>
<p class="half-break"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does this stunned guard have a weapon on him?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>⇢ It's quite likely, let's say there's a <strong>one chance in two</strong>.</p>
<p>➜ &ldquo;Choose: even or odd? Then roll a die, and if you predicted correctly, your Runner finds a weapon.&nbsp;&raquo;</p>
<p class="half-break"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are the truck keys stashed in the glove box?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>⇢ It's possible but <strong>quite unlikely</strong>.</p>
<p>➜ &ldquo;Roll a die, on a 6 you find the keys.&nbsp;&raquo;</p>
<p class="half-break"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Which one of you does the monster attack?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>⇢ Each Runner has <strong>an equal chance</strong> of being attacked.</p>
<p>➜ &ldquo;Each choose a number between 1 and 6, then the die will determine who will be targeted.&nbsp;&raquo;
<em>(by re-rolling until a player's number is drawn)</em></p>

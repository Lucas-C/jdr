<center>
 These entirely optional rules handle some situations not provided for in the rules,
and humbly try to improve the gaming experience.
</center>
<h2 id="injuries">Injuries</h2>
<p>For injuries to impact game mechanics:</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>A Fugitive with an <strong>untreated wound</strong> must always place a die on the <strong>Wound</strong> Risk without <strong>rolling an additional die</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="memories">Memories</h2>
<p>The players <strong>share their Questions</strong> orally at the start of the game.
Explain that placing a ⚃ or ⚄ in <strong>Souvenir</strong> grants narrative power
who can help the Fugitives, for example by introducing an item or an ally!</p>
<!-- = flashback in Blades in the Dark -->
<p>Sometimes, while investigating his past during the game,
a Fugitive can get answers to his Questions
without placing a die on the Risk <strong>Remembrance</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>When a player thinks that her Fugitive has found an answer to one of her questions,
with the GM's agreement she can <strong>read this question</strong> to others.
Each of them <strong>then offers an explanation</strong>,
then the initial player chooses the answer she prefers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-track">The Track</h2>
<p>This rule can be very useful if the Fugitives <strong>outrun</strong> the Pursuers,
in order to restore dramatic tension:</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>The GM can decide that the Pursuers catch up with their prey on the Trail
until the <strong>post-it just behind the Fugitives one</strong>.
However, this <strong>triggers a Memory</strong> to one of the Fugitives, at their convenience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Repel the Pursuers</strong>: if the Fugitives confront and push back the Pursuers in a Location,
the latter move back a notch on the Track.</p>
<p><strong>Vehicles</strong>: only include them as locations in the Track if the Fugitives stay there <strong>for a scene</strong>, for example a chase.</p>
<h2 id="mutual-aid">Mutual aid</h2>
<p>If ever the players help each other to carry out a significant action:</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>When the help of one or more Fugitives proves relevant during the action of another Fugitive, the latter can roll an additional die.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>The GM is free to consider that such assistance does not provide a significant advantage depending on the situation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="identical-action-of-all-fugitives">Identical action of all Fugitives</h2>
<p>Example&nbsp;:</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>The three of us take our momentum to jump into the void to the adjacent building.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It can then be laborious to ask the three players for a dice roll:</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>When the Fugitives perform the same significant action simultaneously, designate a player who will make a single dice roll, the result of which will determine the overall success of the action.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="random-decisions">Random decisions</h2>
<p>Sometimes the Fugitives do not perform any significant action,
but a die roll can be helpful in determining the situation.
Examples:</p>
<p class="half-break"></p>
<blockquote>
 <p>Does this stunned guard have a weapon on him?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>⇢ It's quite likely, let's say there's a <strong>one chance in two</strong>.</p>
<p>➜ &ldquo;Choose: even or odd? Then roll a die, and if you predicted correctly, your Fugitive finds a weapon.&nbsp;&raquo;</p>
<p class="half-break"></p>
<blockquote>
 <p>Are the truck keys stashed in the glove box?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>⇢ It's possible but <strong>quite unlikely</strong>.</p>
<p>➜ &ldquo;Roll a die, on a 6 you find the keys.&nbsp;&raquo;</p>
<p class="half-break"></p>
<blockquote>
 <p>Which one of you does the monster attack?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>⇢ Each Fugitive has <strong>an equal chance</strong> of being attacked.</p>
<p>➜ &ldquo;Each choose a number between 1 and 6, then the die will determine who will be targeted.&nbsp;&raquo;
<em>(by re-rolling until a player's number is drawn)</em></p>
